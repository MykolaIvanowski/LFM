The LEFT() function in SQL is used to extract a specified number of characters
from the left side of a string.
It's quite handy when you need to isolate parts of a string based on a given length.
LEFT(string, number_of_characters)

SELECT full_name, LEFT(full_name, 3) AS name_initials
FROM employees;
This query will return a result set where each row includes the full_name and
the first three characters of that name as name_initials.

select name, avg(int_value) from table

name int_value
bob     2

using()

The USING() clause in SQL is used in joins to simplify the syntax when two tables
have one or more columns in common, typically with the same names

examples:

    SELECT columns
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
    ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

the same:

    SELECT columns
    FROM table1
    JOIN table2
    USING (common_column);

rounded_value
123.46
