The LEFT() function in SQL is used to extract a specified number of characters
from the left side of a string.
It's quite handy when you need to isolate parts of a string based on a given length.
LEFT(string, number_of_characters)

SELECT full_name, LEFT(full_name, 3) AS name_initials
FROM employees;
This query will return a result set where each row includes the full_name and
the first three characters of that name as name_initials.
